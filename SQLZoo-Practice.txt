1) Modify [SELECT * FROM goal WHERE player LIKE '%Bender';] to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
Answer:
SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
WHERE teamid = 'GER';

2) Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
Answer:
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
FROM game WHERE id = 1012;

3) The code below shows the player (from the goal) & stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.
    SELECT player,stadium FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid);
Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
Answer:
SELECT go.player,go.teamid,ga.stadium,ga.mdate
FROM game ga JOIN goal go ON (ga.id=go.matchid)
WHERE go.teamid = 'GER';

4) Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
Answer:
SELECT ga.team1, ga.team2, go.player
FROM game ga JOIN goal go ON (ga.id=go.matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%';

5) Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
Answer:
SELECT g.player, g.teamid, e.coach, g.gtime
FROM goal g JOIN eteam e ON (g.teamid = e.id)
WHERE g.gtime<=10;

6) List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
Answer:
SELECT g.mdate, e.teamname FROM game g
JOIN eteam e ON (g.team1 = e.id)
WHERE e.coach = 'Fernando Santos';

7) List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
Answer:
SELECT player FROM goal go
JOIN game ga ON (go.matchid=ga.id)
WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';

------------------------- More difficult questions -------------------------

8) The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
    SELECT player, gtime FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND team2='GRE');
Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
Answer:
SELECT DISTINCT player FROM game ga
JOIN goal go ON go.matchid=ga.id 
WHERE (go.teamid!='GER' AND (ga.team1='GER' OR ga.team2='GER'));

9) Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
Answer:
SELECT e.teamname, count(g.teamid)
FROM eteam e JOIN goal g ON e.id=g.teamid
GROUP BY e.teamname;

10) Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
Answer:
SELECT ga.stadium, count(go.teamid) AS goals_scored FROM game ga
JOIN goal go ON (go.matchid=ga.id)
GROUP BY ga.stadium;

11) For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
Given:  SELECT matchid,mdate, team1, team2,teamid FROM game
        JOIN goal ON matchid = id WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL');
Answer:
SELECT matchid,mdate,count(mdate) FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL') GROUP BY matchid,mdate;

12) For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
Answer:
SELECT matchid, mdate, count(mdate) FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
WHERE (teamid='GER') GROUP BY matchid,mdate;

13) List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.
    mdate	        team1	score1	team2	score2
    1  July 2012	ESP	    4	    ITA	    0
    10 June 2012	ESP	    1	    ITA	    1
    10 June 2012	IRL	    1	    CRO	    3
    ...
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1.
Given:  SELECT mdate, team1,
        CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END score1
        FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id;
Answer:
SELECT mdate, team1, sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
       team2, sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;

1) List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
Answer:
SELECT t.name FROM teacher t
WHERE t.dept IS NULL;

2) Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
Answer: GIVEN TO ILLUSTRATE BAD RETURN
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);

3) Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
Answer:
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);

4) Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
Answer:
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher
RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);

5) Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'
Answer:
SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile,'07986 444 2266') AS mobile_number FROM teacher;

6) Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.
Answer:
SELECT t.name, COALESCE(d.name,'None') as dept FROM teacher t
LEFT JOIN dept d ON (t.dept=d.id);

7) Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.
Answer:
SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile) FROM teacher;

8) Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.
Answer:
SELECT d.name,COUNT(t.name) FROM teacher t
RIGHT JOIN dept d ON (t.dept=d.id) GROUP BY d.name;

9) Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.
Answer:
SELECT t.name, CASE
               WHEN t.dept=1 OR t.dept=2 THEN 'Sci'
               ELSE 'Art'
               END
FROM teacher t LEFT JOIN dept d ON (t.dept=d.id);

10) Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.
Answer:
SELECT t.name, CASE
               WHEN t.dept=1 OR t.dept=2 THEN 'Sci'
               WHEN t.dept=3 THEN 'Art'
               ELSE 'None'
               END
FROM teacher t LEFT JOIN dept d ON (t.dept=d.id);
